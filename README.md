# LieDetection
# GOAL : True/Lie Detection Using Sequences
Create Lie Detection Model using ML (Final Yr USJP Research Project)

Steps:

01. Extract Keypoints from video using mediapipe fashmesh
02. Train an LSTM DL Model
03. Make real time predictions using sequences



# How it Works
  01. Extract Keypoints from mediapipe fashmesh 
  2. Train a deep neural network with LSTM layers for sequences
  3. Perform real time True/ Lie Detection using OpenCV
